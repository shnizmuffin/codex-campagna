The Bar of Holding
---

> You find yourself inside a simple, clean, brightly lit two-story inn. It's the type of inn you might find in a quaint mountain village except for the distinct lack of windows or doors. The downstairs bar is devoid of other patrons, populated only by stools, tables, mugs, and large labeled barrels of beer and wine from around the world. A short flight of stairs leads to a narrow corridor from which branch guest rooms.

Between each level, our heroes find themselves transported to a strange, extra-dimensional inn. There is no way to the outside world, and all doors lead in short dimensional hops to other parts of the inn. A single black wooden door in the downstairs bar does not open at all. It leads to level 13 and will not open until our heroes get there.

Each guest room is simple, but well suited to its occupant. A druid’s room might have a banzai plant, a wizard’s room might have a smattering of old books, and a paladin’s room might have a small alter to his god.

> Along the narrow upstairs corridor are thirteen paintings. They depict, in order:
> 
> 1. A large tan block of stone flanked by torches.
> 1. A five headed hydra in a glass cage.
> 1. A ghostly figure at the end of a feast laden table.
> 1. A cell door with a silver key.
> 1. A tall block of obsidian inlaid with purple runes.
> 1. An advancing wall with protruding spikes.
> 1. A gothic cathedral against a bloody sunset.
> 1. A wall of purple shimmering force between two black pillars.
> 1. A campfire in a dark forest.
> 1. A corpse in a black void.
> 1. An ornate chandelier.
> 1. A dusty coliseum.
> 1. Finally, a portrait of a handsome young man with blonde hair, a razor sharp jaw line, and piercing silver eyes. If asked, Nine will reveal that this is Jacob.

The thirteen paintings represent the thirteen levels of Jacob’s Tower.

The Inn's only other occupants are a mechanical humanoid known as "Nine" and his construct cat companion "C." Nine is the everyman here, full time bartender, shopkeep, blackmith, entertainment, and conversationalist. Nine will happily buy anything the heroes have, and sell any item they require, generating the products out of thin air. He also provides the characters with rooms to sleep in, free of charge.

Nine is well aware that he is an extra-dimensional, magical construct and is very happy to serve Jacob. Nine is the 9th in a line of similar extra-dimensional magical constructs made by Jacob. Each in turn has been retired and replaced with more efficient models, but through the process of incremental improvements Nine appears to be near the pinnacle of Jacob’s craft. Nine's only apparent flaw is a speech impediment - he has exactly one tone and very flat inflection. Nine makes up for it by stating his inflection at the begining of each sentence or two.

> "Optimistically. Hello, guests, my name is Nine. Welcome to the Bar of Holding. How can I help you?"
>
> "Expectantly. Would you like rooms, or a hot meal? There is no charge for Jacob's guests."

Nine is charismatic and pleasant to talk to. Though not a show off, he thoroughly enjoys impressing adventurers with his skills and magical abilities.

Nine, and the constructs before him, are powered by the souls of adventurers who have died within the tower. If a PC dies within the tower, some of his ticks and oddities may manifest themselves subtly in Nine.

If asked about Jacob, or the purpose of the tower, Nine will be obtuse. He will explain that Jacob is a pleasant and powerful sorcerer, and though although Nine does not know the true purpose of the tower he can only assume Jacob built it with the best of intentions.

At least, that is the explanation that Nine gives as to his own existence, Jacob, and the tower. The true nature of Nine is revealed in level 13, at the end of Jacob’s Tower.

Shortly before going to sleep each night, our heroes will level up and be able to prepare any spells. They will have dreamless sleep, then wake up on the stairs to the next level.
