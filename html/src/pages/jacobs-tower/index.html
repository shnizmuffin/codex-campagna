Introduction
----

Jacob’s Tower is the perfect fast paced dungeon crawl for the Pathfinder RPG. Regardless of your world, plot, or players, it is easily run in any campaign or as a megadungeon.

The dungeon is designed to test a party’s versatility and flexibility, utilizing every skill and creature type in the book over every three Levels. It both introduces new players to the wonders of Pathfinder and gives experienced players a non-traditional setting in which to test their skills.

Each Level of Jacob's Tower corresponds to the Average Party level designed to play it. Level 1 is designed for characters of level 1, Level 2 is designed for characters of level 2, Level 3 is designed for characters of level 3, and so on. Each Level can be easily brought into your campaign at the appropriate party level, either for a fun break or a real, plot relevant dungeon.

Alternatively, the entire Tower can be played one Level after another. Such an experience is an excellent chance to blow off some steam and test the player's Pathfinder chops. If you choose to run Jacob's Tower in this way, our heroes gain an addition bit of gold every level to make up for the quick leveling, as indicated at the end of the text.

Regardless of performance or enemies killed, players will receive a set amount of experience points for completing a Level as indicated at the start of the level. Some monsters exist only as deterrents, and the PCs should know they will get the same amount of experience points if they avoid the monster or kill it. However, the treasure that they get is entirely dependent on what they actually pick up.

### Adjusting Difficulty

Jacob's Tower is made for an average party of 3 and a half characters. However, all parties are very different, and adjusting difficulty is very easy.

If you have more than four characters, or if your characters are well built, add the advanced template to all enemies.  This is essentially +2 to AC, attack, damage, saves, and DCs.  Additionally, add +2 to all skill checks in the dungeon.  If they are still breezing through encounters, you can add it again, or double the hit points of enemies.

If you are only playing with one or two characters, or your players are still coming to grips with the system, then adjusting is even easier.  Simply play the levels at a higher level than designated.  Start your characters at character level 2 for Level 1, and advance them such that they are consistently one above level at all times.

Character Hooks
---

Some elements of each level can be tweaked to fit an existing campaign setting.

### The Bar of Holding

This level assumes the PCs have favorite beers.

- Beer and menu selections. The text states that the beers available are specifically the PC's favorites.

### Level One

- All the *wrong* paintings in **Room 8: The Many Paintings of Malebolge**.

### Level Two

- The deity the Abrikandilu Demon is praying to in **Room 5: The Praying Demon**.

### Level Three

This level requires information about the PCs. Specifically, a location they have all been to, people they've met in that location, and their religious affiliations.

- The location all the PCs have been to, and Billy et al are from. This location should have a place important to Eravyl the Elven Paladin (like a temple or a shrine). It should have a mutual acquaintance of the party and Durdam the Dwarven Rogue.
- In **Room 7: Eravyl, Elven Paladin**, the GM can change Eravyl the Elven Paladin's diety.
- The "dead friends" in **Room 8: Beneath a Graveyard**.

### Level Four

This level requires information about the PCs. Specifically, a litany of past misdeeds.

- In **Room 2: Gambling Orcs**, Bernard's Note contains numerical information that can be changed to fit the setting.

### Level Five

This level requires information about the PCs. Specifically, their earliest or most important memory.

- In **Room 6: Four Questions**, the questions can be changed to fit the setting.

### Level Six

This level requires information about the PCs. Specifically, a few of their acquaintances and the person about whom they feel the most guilt.

### Level Seven

- Hellbrooke Cathedral's history can be changed to fit the setting.
- The knowledge checks in **Room 1: Cathedral, Chalice, and Tomb** can reveal anything.
- The engraving in **Room 3: Bishop’s Mausoleum** should be changed to reflect any changes to the history.
- The books in **Room 4: Library** can pertain to the current setting instead of being randomly generated.
- Saint Kailon Runard's history in **Room 7: Saint’s Tomb** should be changed to reflect any changes to the history.
- The patron of **Room 9: Basement** can be changed to any aquatic deity.
- The name and history of Henry Bellows in **Room 11: King’s Tomb** can be changed to anything.

> I recommend changing his name to "Kerry the Slayer" as a nod to Kerry King, lead guitarist of Slayer and songwriter of Reign in Blood. *Bones of a King, get it?*

### Level Eight

- The entirety of **Room 1: Material Plane** must be changed to match the current setting.

### Level Nine

Level nine has a bunch of busted rules that might not work if you're using the PFSRD.

> The presented eating and hunger rules for this level don't make sense. [Here are the real rules](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules/#Starvation_and_Thirst). If you want to threaten the players with thirst and starvation, make their stay in this area much longer than 24 hours, or have them wake up already parched and hungry. Remember, they're 8th level now. This should be beneath them.
>
> Same goes for the rules of sleeping and fatigue. [Here are the real rules for those](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#Rest). If you want to threaten the PCs with exhaustion, make their stay here longer or don't let them wake up invigorated. Tell them they're woken up by screams *or some shit* every time they try to rest, and it feels like they've been up for a day or so. *Remember, they're 8th level now. This should be beneath them.*
>
> Also, the rules for keeping a campfire lit *make no sense either*. As long as PCs dedicate some time every few hours to gather wood and throw it on the fire, there should be no chance of it going out. If you want to threaten the PCs with the campfire going out, [throw some weather at them](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/weather/) or make it increasingly harder to find kindling. *Remember, they're 8th level now. This should be beneath them.* **Kill them if it isn't.**

- **The Peddler**'s descriptions of items can be altered.
- **The Witch** could come from / go to a town known to the PCs.

### Level Ten

- Haradim's background can be changed to fit the setting.

### Level Eleven

- In **Room 3: Den**, the card game can be changed to match the setting.

> This seems like a good time to let the PCs actually play a card game.

### Level Twelve

### Level Thirteen
