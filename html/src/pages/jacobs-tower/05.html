Level 5: Runewall
---

> You find yourselves hurtling through a black abyss. Strange and unfamiliar stars dot the void all around you. As you twirl weightlessly, the stars move in disparate and unintuitive directions - shattering your perception of where you are. From out of the darkness your companions go whizzing past, each on their own trajectory. First, they cross your face. Then, they overtake you. Then, they fall from above. Are you moving, or are they? After a long, disorienting while, a glowing purple square appears far below you. Holding your arm outstretched, you cover it completely with your thumb - you and it are aligned. The stars around you slowly come to a standstill as your companions drift towards you. Once each of you are at arm's reach, the stars uniformly jerk downward towards the distant square before blasting upward at incomprehensible speeds. Their pinpoint light stretches into prismatic lines as the square beneith you snaps closer, its massiveness suddenly revealed, as you scream towards it. You reflexively flinch, slamming your eyes closed and futilly bracing for terminal impact. You hear not the bonesnapping splatter of your liquified companions, but instead the gentle patter of footfalls as you feel soild ground alight under your feet. "Welcome to Runewall," bellows a deep, disembodied voice.

Runewall is clearly brimming with magical energies. It is made entirely of black and shining obsidian, and every square inch of the level is carved with complex runes that glow brightly purple.

There are large, 5 foot thick obsidian walls throughout Runewall. These walls are 20 feet tall and are marked in purple on the map. It is possible and sometimes necessary to climb up on top of these walls, and the runes give the walls a **Climb DC of 10**.

### Random Teleportation

There are many holes in the level that lead back into the abyss. These squares are marked with black on the map. If a character falls through one of these squares, he will tumble down towards the stars below him for the remainder of the turn. On his next turn Runewall will rush up to meet him, and he will land somewhere on the level. To determine where on the level he lands, roll three d6s and add the results, then refer to the numbers running across the top of the level. This determines the column he lands in.  Next, roll three d6s, add the results, and refer to the numbers running across the side of the level. This determines the row he lands in.  Choose the appropriate column and row to place the character in. Although the characters hurtle at immense speed through the abyss, they take only d6 damage when they hit the ground (but they do fall prone). A **DC 15 Acrobatics** check negates this damage and results in the character landing on his feet.

The character who touches a rune crystal is also teleported.

```aside
Since 3d6 can never result in a 1 or 2, there are 66 squares a character will never fall into using this method. Furthermore, there is a very high chance (~48%) of rolling a 9-12, meaning a character will most likely land somewhere around the southeast corner of room one 24% of the time.

If this seems stupid to you: Roll 1d20 and let 1 and 20 represent the edges of the platform and a chance to grab on (and take no damage). Results of 1 or 20 can also represent acceleration or decelleration, respectively. - N
```

### Under Runewall

Every time that a character falls through the level, have him make a **DC 16 Perception** check. On a success, the character notices a Mithral Chain Shirt (small) and +1 Buckler (small) attached with loose straps to the bottom of the level underneath 1a. If a character attempts to fly to get these items, he must pass a **DC 18 Fly** check or get sucked down into the abyss and fall back onto Runewall. A character may attempt to climb to the items from one of the holes in room 1, but doing so is extremely difficult and requires **DC 30 Climb** checks. If the Mithral Chain Shirt and +1 Buckler are knocked loose, they will fall to a random square on Runewall.

### Mindswitch

When our heroes first land in Runewall, they will have a few moments to get their bearings. After a round or two, the runes in the walls start to take effect. Each player feels the symbols around him burning into his vision and seeping into his subconscious. Even blind characters or characters with their eyes closed somehow see the runes searing through their retinas.

All character should quickly make a **DC 20 Spellcraft** check. If any character makes the check, he can warn the group to focus on his earliest or most important memory. This will grant a +2 to all subsequent Mindswitch Will saves.

Each character (just characters, not eidolons, animal companions, minions and the like) should make a **DC 21 Will** save . If a character fails, he feels his mind being ripped from him. The player should pass his character sheet to the next player who failed the check on his left, and receive a new character sheet from the next player who failed the check on his right. The character’s mind, including all his memories, personality, and beliefs, has just transferred to the body of a new character. He has gained all new skills, attributes, abilities, feats, spells, and abilities scores and understands immediately how to use them. He will be shocked to learn that he no longer remembers how to do some things that were basic to his old body, but suddenly understands new and wondrous ideas. Alignment restrictions to classes are temporarily removed.

If a character dies, it is the character controlling the body who suffers the consequences. The mind that controlled the dead body move on to the afterlife. The dead body is brought back to life at the end of the level, ready for its original owner to return.  The body of the dead mind dies at the end of the level and does not advance to the next level.  Spells such as resurrection may bring the dead character back to life.  Additionally, any permanent damage dealt to any body, such as loss of fingers or ability drain, is healed.  The player should be told this rule as a consequence of the mind-switch.

Whenever any character touches a Rune Crystal, Mindswitch occurs again.  Each character should make a **DC 21 Will** save or switch bodies.  Mindswitch ends when the level ends.

If only one member of the party fails the save, his mind has nowhere to go and stays put.

Note that players can voluntarily fail any of these saves, which they may want to do to get their character back.

#### Know Your Players

Runewall functions just fine without the Mindswitch mechanic.  GM's should carefully consider if their players will enjoy the chaos of passing character sheets around and playing somebody else.  If your players are more freeform and into roleplaying, they will likely enjoy it.  If your players are more into the mechanical side of things and looking forward to flexing their muscles, they may not.  Choose wisely, and ask your players if you are unsure.

### Protector of the Walls

The walls of this level are fairly easy to climb, requiring a **DC 10 Climb** check. However, they are not unguarded. The first time a character reaches the top of the walls, he will be attacked by a Flame Drake. The Flame Drake, who lurks in the inky darkness approximately 300 feet away from the level, will fly in to and attack any on the walls.  If no PCs are on the walls, he will turn tail and fly back to his station 300 feet away and obscured by the blackness. The Flame Drake will primarily shoot fireballs from the air, though he will hover above enemies for melee attacks when appropriate.

When the Flame Drake is killed, he will plummet to Runewall. Where he falls, his corpse will smolder and smoke for days, dealing d6 fire damage a round to any in contact with it. Upon his defeat, players may make a **DC 10 Knowledge (Arcana)** check to reveal that a Flame Drake’s heart is very valuable. A character may spend a turn in contact with the corpse to attempt a **DC 15 Knowledge (Arcana)** check to retrieve the Drake heart, which can be sold for 1,000gp.  This check may be retried, but each attempt deals d6 fire damage to the player.

The first time somebody climbs the walls, he gains view of most of the level.  This includes the Crystals in Room 2, The Chemosit statue in Room 4, and the various monsters in Room 7.

### Room 1: Central Crystal

> The center of the floor in this room is divided into nine equal squares, three columns by three rows. The center square is obsidian, but the other squares are made of glass. 

Each of these eight glass squares corresponds to a rune-crystal that must be activated in Runewall. Touching the rune-crystals throughout the level will activate the nearest square of glass, causing it to glow and hum slightly.

When a player activates a rune-crystal, he transported to a random square on the level as if he had just fallen through one of the holes in the floor.  Additionally, all characters undergo another **DC 21 will** save to avoid Mindswitch.

Once all eight rune-crystals are activated, the central obsidian center square opens and a crystal shard will rise out of it. When this shard is touched, the final boss will appear.

#### Northwest Corner

To the northwest of the center room is a locked box with a complex linguistic cipher.  A **DC 14 Linguistics** check reveals the passcode, and speaking this word will cause the chest to open. However, failing the linguistics check three times will cause the box to lock permanently. There appears to be no lock or key, so the box cannot be opened with a Disable Device attempt. Inside the chest is a Wand of Charm Animal (CL1), a Potion of Fly (CL5), a Potion of Heroism (CL5), and a Hand of the Mage.

| Amt. | Treasure | Value | Weight |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Wand of [Charm Animal](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-animal/) (CL1) | 750 gp | 0 lbs. |
| 1 | Potion of [Fly](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fly/) (CL5) | 750 gp | 0 lbs. |

| 1 | [Hand of the Mage](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hand-of-the-mage/) | 900 gp | 2 lbs. |

#### Northeast Corner

> To the northeast of the room is a small wooden chest.

Although the chest is unlocked, it is trapped with [insanity mist](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/insanity-mist-trap-cr-8/). Inside the chest are five sleep arrows and a +1 Longbow.

| 1 | +1 Longbow | 750 gp | 0 lbs. |

#### Southeast Corner

> To the southeast of the room is a large box made of small iron bars and glass. Inside the box is a fragile and expensive looking Fabergé egg. However, the box itself is poorly made, and there are a few bars blocking the egg. Three beams will have to be carefully removed to access the egg.

The character should make three consecutive **DC 10 Knowledge (Engineering)** checks to remove non-structural beams. If he fails any one of these the box collapses, crushing both the egg and his hand for d6 damage. If he succeeds he retrieves the Faberge egg, worth a tidy sum of 1,000gp.  Alternatively, a **DC 22 Sleight of Hand** check will access the egg, though failure means the box collapses.

| Amt. | Treasure | Value | Weight |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Faberge Egg, fragile | 1,000 gp | 1 lbs. |

```aside
This doesn't make sense. - N
```

#### Southwest Corner

> To the southwest of this room is a locked chest.

It requires a **DC 30 Disable Device** check to unlock, though our heroes may make as many attempts as they like. Inside are three bear traps, a magnifying glass, masterwork manacles, a magical vial of incense, and one dose of Dark Reaver Powder. A **DC 21 Spellcraft** check will reveal the incense to be Incense of Meditation.  However, a **DC 31 Spellcraft** check will reveal the item's true identity, the cursed Incense of Obsession.

| Amt. | Treasure | Value | Weight |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | [Bear Trap](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/traps-hazards-and-special-terrains/traps/bear-traps-cr-1/) | 2 gp | 10 lbs. |
| 1 | Magnifying Glass | 100 gp | 0 lbs. |
| 1 | Masterwork Manacles | 50 gp | 2 lbs. |
| 1 | [Dark Reaver Powder](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/dark-reaver-powder/) | 800 gp | 0 lbs. |
| 1 | Cursed [Incense of Obsession](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/cursed-items/#TOC-Incense-of-Obsession) | 1,000 gp | 1 lbs. |

### Room 2: The Shiniest Crystal

> Eight large crystal shards hover over a raised platform, slowly humming and turning. When you see them, runes and images flash through your head. You immediately understand that you must touch only the most valuable crystal, and avoid all others.

To determine the most valuable crystal, a character should attempt a **DC 20 Appraise** check.

If a player fails the check, he touches one of the seven incorrect crystals. The crystal immediately explodes, dealing 2d6+1 damage to all within a 10 foot radius of it. A **DC 18 Reflex** check halves this damage. The DC of the Appraise check decreases by 2 for each destroyed crystal.

If he succeeds in the check, the character touches the most valuable crystal and it activates as a rune-crystal. At this point, the remaining crystals will melt into piles of gold worth 250gp each.

### Room 3: Gauntlet Legends

> At the southern edge of the room are three archways of different and varied materials. The portal at the western edge of the room is a hodgepodge of junk – broken weapons, sharpened sticks, and animal bones, all tied together with fraying rope. The center portal is made up of nothing but human bones, primarily femurs and skulls. The eastern portal is a damp arch of grey-green stone dripping a foul smelling liquid. An iron grate covers most of the portal except for a 2 foot hole gnawed in the bottom.

For as long as at least one character maintains line of sight with at least one of the portals, every portal begins to spawn enemies. There can only be a maximum of 15 spawned enemies at a time. These enemies spawn as if summoned, acting immediately upon appearing. They act on their portal’s turn.

Each portal has hardness 5, 20 hit points, and a **break DC of 25**. They are medium sized objects with an AC of 3, and, if brought down to 0 hit points, they stop producing enemies.

The western portal has an initiative modifier of +6, and each turn it spawns one Goblin.  If any PCs are on the walls, the Goblins will draw their short bows and focus on them. Three small fireworks attached to the arch send off a stream of sparklers from whenever the arch spawns a Goblin.

The center portal has an initiative modifier of +6, and each turn it spawns one medium humanoid Skeleton.  Each time a Skeleton spawns, the bones of the portal shake with a horrifying clacking sound.

The eastern portal has an initiative modifier of +3, and each turn a Dire Rat shoots forth in a cloud of putrid green mist.

Once all three portals are destroyed, a rune-crystal will rise from the ground.

### Room 4: The Stone Ape

> The platform is bare except for a giant statue of a fearsome ape. The 10 foot tall statue is shaggy and fearsome, with massive teeth bared in a devilish grin. Atop the feral hulk is a stone crown with a rune-crystal set in the center.

A **DC 14 Knowledge (Arcana)** check will reveal that this is a statue of a Chemosit, a powerful magical beast that devours the brains of its enemies.

Room 4 is on a raised platform, accessible only by scaling the wall.

Atop the feral hulk is a stone crown with a rune-crystal set in the center. If this crystal is touched without touching the Chemosit, then the rune-crystal activates and our heroes can proceed on their way. However, if the Chemosit is touched it will immediately come to life and attack our players. The creature will, whenever possible, attempt to bull rush his opponents off the platform and into the holes in the ground.

During combat with the Chemosit, our heroes may attempt to touch and activate the rune-crystal. Doing so requires a combat maneuver check against the Chemosit's CMD of 26. If the maneuver is successful the rune-crystal activates and the Chemosit turns back into stone.

### Room 5: Dodging the Waves

> At the southern corner of Runewall is a snaking tunnel through the obsidian. This tunnel is 15 feet high with an additional 5 feet of obsidian as a roof closing it in. The air inside the tunnel is thick with magical energies, and moving through it is akin to moving through water.

The eastern most squares of the tunnel have a wall separating them from the void.  Thus, the yellow squares act as difficult terrain.

At the end of the tunnel is a rune-crystal, which can only be activated by standing on the final square. Every turn, the rune-crystal sends out a yellow horizontal bar at a random height, which speeds down the tunnel and dissipates at its exit. Characters within the tunnel must make a **DC 18 Acrobatics** check, or be dealt 2d6 sonic damage and forced four squares backwards.

```aside
It would stand to reason that smaller characters have less of a chance of getting hit. - N
```

Once the rune-crystal is touched, it activates and the shockwaves cease.

### Room 6: Four Questions

> There are four floating gemstones - blue, black, white, and green - one in each corner of the room. As you enter the room, you hear a voice in your head. “Order matters,” it will say in a grave tone, “Listen to the stones.” 

Each gemstone speaks telepathically as our heroes approach it, letting our heroes know the order to activate them. Each character may only attempt each knowledge check once. Touching a gemstone will cause it to glow, and it will stop glowing after all four gemstones have been touched. Touching these stones does not cause the player to be teleported to a random location.

When a gemstone is touched it will glow slightly, but dim and reset after all four have been touched. If the gemstones are touched in the correct order, then the center platform will open revealing a crystal.

However, if the gemstones are touched in the incorrect order, the player touching the final stone will be afflicted with horrible pain to the tune of 3d6+3 damage, **DC 20 Will** save halves. This pain occurs after the fourth gemstone is touched, and there is no indication of which part of the sequence was incorrect.  Each time the gemstones are touched incorrectly, one of the gemstones transmits which number it is.

#### Blue Gemstone

> How many rulers of Halford have been named Dailor?

A **DC 13 Knowledge (Nobility)** check will reveal that the current ruler is Grand Prince Stavian III, so there have been three rulers. This is the third gemstone that must be touched.

#### Black Gemstone

> How many nostrils does a Fen Witch have?

A **DC 13 Knowledge (Nature)** check will reveal that the answer is one, and this is the first gemstone that must be touched.

#### White Gemstone

> Excepting Charlotte's Strait, how many oceans are in Fold?

A **DC 13 Knowledge (Geography)** check will reveal that there are five oceans total on Golarion, four excepting Okaiyo. This is the fourth gemstone that must be touched.

#### Green Gemstone

> How many gods, known as the ‘First,’ were born from the ‘Seal?’

A **DC 13 Knowledge (Religion)** check will reveal that the answer is two, Ihys and Asmodeus, and this is the second gemstone that must be touched.

### Room 7: Monsters on the Walls

A number of monstrous humanoids guard these walls from adventurers. Four Dire Corbies wait on the middle wall, but will leap to engage the heroes once approached.

On the farthest northeast wall stands a single Ceratioidi with a pile of ten spears beside him. The Ceratioidi will throw spears and use his lure ability on the PCs. A rune-crystal is on the same platform as the Ceratioidi.

The area above the outer wall is protected by a permanent wind wall which will block any projectiles heading through it.  The enemies in this area will watch but not attack the PCs unless they are attacked first or a PC breaches the wind wall.  However, if the enemies are attacked they will leave their area to fight the agressors.

### Room 8: A Face in the Wall 

> A large, smiling face is carved into the wall around this corner. It has two twinkling ruby eyes and a gigantic smiling mouth. When you approach, he happily exclaims “Adventurers! It’s been so long, and I’ve been so bored! Would one of you mind entertaining me?”

He will continue to ask for entertainment if questioned.

Our heroes will have three chances to make a **DC 18 Perform** check to gain access to the crystal. If they get a 23 on the check, the face will be so amused he will throw in one of his eyes, worth 600gp. If they get a 28 on the check, he will throw in both of his eyes, each worth 600gp.

If our heroes fail all three **DC 18 perform** checks, the face will be annoyed and demand 1,000gp in exchange for his crystal. If the money is fed into his mouth, or an items worth at least 2,000gp, he will produce the crystal.

However, the face is a coward. He should flinch if any character draws a weapon of makes any move that could be interpreted as menacing. He can be persuaded into giving up his crystal with a **DC 21 Intimidate** check. A 26 will intimidate the face into giving up one of his eyes as well, worth 600gp, and a 31 will intimidate the face into giving up both of his eyes, worth 600gp each.  Our heroes will only have one chance to make this intimidate check - otherwise, he will demand the gold.

Alternatively, our heroes can attempt to forcefully remove each eye with a **DC 20 strength** check.  After each failure, the player must make a **DC 16 Reflex** check or be dealt d12 damage from the eyelid coming down.  If both eyes are removed, the face will trade the crystal to get them back.

Once he has been persuaded one way or another, the face will open up his mouth, revealing the rune-crystal inside.

### Room 9: Spitting Plants

When our heroes enter the northwest room, it appears to be completely empty. However, the first time a hero crosses the checkerboard pattern, two Calathgars drop suddenly from the sky and combat begins. One turn later, a rune-crystal drops from the sky and lands softly on the ground.

### Final Boss: The Glass Golem 

Once all eight crystals throughout the level have been activated, a larger crystal appears from the ground. Once this is touched, every character is teleported to a random square on the map. Simultaneously, a Glass Golem appears in the center of the room and begins to attack. Once the Golem is defeated, the entire level disappears beneath their feet, and our heroes find themselves once more hurtling through the abyss.

If our heroes are playing only in Jacob's Tower and ranking up to Level 6, then distribute 8,400 gold amongst them evenly.

### Sleeping in Runewall

Each night that our heroes sleep on Runewall, runes and symbols permeate their dreams. Each character should make a **DC 14 Will** save. If a character fails this save, he has not slept a wink, gets no benefits from sleeping, is now fatigued, and takes 2 Wisdom drain. If a character makes the save then he had a reasonable night’s sleep with all the benefits that it brings.
