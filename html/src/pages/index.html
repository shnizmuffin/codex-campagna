### Gnomish Library

> Bookshelves line most of the walls of this small library. Whatever furnishings once occupied the room now lie in a chopped heap of wood in the middle of the room, some of it currently alight beneith a small cooking pot. Four bedrolls surround the small fire, spread out on the bare but even floor. The rough eight foot tall cieling is dark with soot. A simple wooden door leads north, A reinforced wooden door leads west.

Any character that can read Gnomish may spend one hour using the library to research general knowledge in Religion or Nature with a +3 bonus. Furthermore, characters make a Knowledge check for Monster Lore as if they were trained in Religion or Nature. Each monster lore check takes 1d4 hours to complete.

### Tsarina's Chambers

> A large unmade bed is pushed into the northwest corner of this small bedchamber. Next to it is a sizable wooden wardrobe. A messy desk covered in papers is nestled along the east wall. A small chest south of the desk completes the room's furnishings. The floor, walls, and cieling are even but unremarkable.

Any character that can read Gnomish may spend one hour attempting a Knowledge (Geography) check to make sense of Tsarina's maps.

### Pantry

> The smell of rotten meat wafts over you as you open what is clearly a pantry. A suprising array of vegtiables, grains, and meats clutter simple wooden tables.

There's nothing else in here.

### Brewery

> Before you even open the door, you smell the pungent armoa of fermenting grain. This small room is filled with brewing equiptment - there's barely enough room for more than one person to move around.

Further investigation (Perception DC 10) reveals a small notebook stating there are two sixels (marked #15 and #16) almost completely conditioned, and another (#17) ready for secondary fermentation.

### Chamber of Eilistraee

> An immaculately clean, polished marble floor and perfectly smooth stone walls set this room completely apart from the room previous. The cieling arches to a point twenty feet up. At the north end of the room, pools of blood sit stagnent under six pike-mounted Svirfneblin surrounding a inlaid silver symbol - a circle around a sword.

>There are two reinforced wooden doors, one leading east; the other west. To the north of the silver symbol is a third door, made of polished steel, adorned with the sillhouette of a naked female elf holding a sword above her head against a full moon.

>At the center of the silver symbol is a gray cloak. Above it floats the mouthless ghost of a deep gnome. The ghost stares at you with wide, unblinking eyes as she drifts towards you - arms outreached.

Tsarina's Ghost will point out the locations of any drow in the area. An [invisible magical barrier](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/u/undeath-ward) prevents Tsarina from leaving the room. The barrier functions in the other direction as [Magic Circle Against Evil](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-circle-against-evil), keeping the drow wary of passing through.

There's a book wrapped under the gray cloak. Tsarina will attack anyone recovering it before the drow are dealt with.

> Don't stay; run away
> She has ordered assassination
> Don't stay; run away
> The henchmen are gathered and waiting
> Don't stay; run away
> Your role as usurper is found out
> Don't stay; run away
> Tsarina has warned of the danger
> 
> It's your own fault
> That is what she wanted
> It's your own fault
> This is where we lay
> 
> By the light of the moon
> You must escape into the deep black of the night
> Fight the devil inside
> Enemies poison deep within my second sight
> Wasting valuable time
> 
> Ride the tides of blood
> Illumination
> Beauties sudden hand
> Shattered crown
> Stretching arms up high
> We're on our way now
> Leave Tsarina to die
> 
> Spiraling up through the crack in the sky
> Leaving material world behind
> I see your face in constellations
> The martyrs are ending their lives for mine

### Tiny Tavern

> The main feature of this small, simple room is a bar jutting out from the north wall. Whatever tables or chairs that used to furnish the room lie in a chopped pile in the southwest corner. A small fire burns south of the bar, with four bedrolls laid around it. A simple wooden door leads north, another leads south. A reinforced wooden door leads east. A passageway, littered with the debris of its collapsed cieling leads west.

There are two sixtels behind the bar, labeled in Gnomish "Svirfneblin Dubbel"

```
1 tapped sixtel (20 pints) of Svirfneblin Dubbel, 500gp, 30lbs

1 untapped sixtel (40 pints) of Svirfneblin Dubbel, 1000gp, 60lbs
```

### Bunkhouse

> Six straw mattresses atop simple wooden bedframes surround a simple hair rug. There are two wooden wardrobes along the east wall. The northwest cieling has caved in.

### Shrine of the Last Baron

> Shattered glass litters the floor around a podium carved to resemble two massive hands. The hands cradle a staff.

> The staff itself is a sturdy mahogony staff crowned by a magnificent orb of Blue Spinel, held in place by four razor-sharp prongs of platinum.

> There are reinforced wooden doors leading north and south from the alcove. Scorch marks are burned into the floor. A pair of skeletal hands clutch the staff at its midpoint.

The staff is a cursed version of [Heretic's Bane](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/staves/heretic-s-bane).

#### The Curse of the Last Baron

Attempting to use the staff results in the spell being cast on the wielder, as if being converted to The Faith. (Fiercely Anti-dragon and anti-magic.)

- Command: Proceed to the Burial Chamber of the Last Baron
- Castigate: Beg for forgiveness for associating with magic
- Zone of Truth: Can't cast spells or activate magic items
- Denounce: Convince those around you to punish you for your magical transgressions

##### Removing the Curse

Remove Curse or returning the staff to the Last Baron removes the curse.
