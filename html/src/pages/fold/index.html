Introduction

The Advanced Transmuter's Guide To Fold is a manual of abridged knowledge deemed pertinent for members of the Arcane Order.

### About the Author

Namodo Nebonic is a Gray Elf Transmuter and Regent of the Arcane Order of N’Hollandi (colloquially referred to as the Seven Spires). He stands a slender 5'6", clad in violet robes with silversilk trim. His skin, like most gray elves, is incredibly pale with a tinge of blue. Dark hair with wisps of silver-white, violet eyes, and long fingernails (useful for handling reagents and turning pages) complete his obvious wizardly appearance.

Namodo was born under a full moon in the winter of 12 BF. He was raised in the Orc age, and clearly remembers the destruction of the Faith at the hands of Orcs. His father, Omando Nebonic, was a Necromancer of moderate power, most famous for raising an army of fallen warriors to entomb the evil dragon Dominamalum for all eternity. When Namodo was 60, a mere child, his father disappeared into one of the Faith's dungeons for "the unsanctioned use of magical energy." His mother, Aredhel Oronar, died in childbirth.

Namodo spent the last 40 years of his adolescence in the care of the Elven high wizard in Neras, Kryptona the Green. He received rigorous instruction in arcana and history. His education included the mastery of common, uncommon, and extinct languages, as well as craftsman-level instruction in architecture and engineering.

When he came of age, Namodo became Kryptona's official apprentice and spent his first years of adulthood fetching weird reagents, magic items, spell components, and the like from various dangerous places. After some time, Namodo outgrew the tutelage Kryptona could give. He received his mastership at 107 and was accepted into the Arcane Order at 110.

From 129 to 154 AF, in his position of Senior Historian of the Arcane Order of Downing, Namodo researched the link between the innate source of draconic magic in its relation to the Weave, and the ways of interruption, disruption, transmutation, and control of that link. His research was instrumental in the creation of the Arcane Order's Spellpool, a reserve of extra magical energy siphoned off the magical powers of a continually Dominated Red Dragon Wyrmling, capable of being transferred over great distances and transmuted into spells.

Namodo fought as an agent of the Arcane Order during the War of the Last Dragons alongside Laurumthrana Anharu the Beguiler, Siggi “Krakenbane” the Divine Dwarf, Rybak the Twicedead Warmage, the Two-Legged Manticore Ivan Vendicasi, and Salty Charlotte the Sea Queen.

During this time, Namodo discovered the fate of his father Omando, who was ultimately slain by Ivan Vendicasi between Hammer and Anvil fighting to protect Magnamalum.

Namodo’s magic was directly responsible for creating the Bone Kraken on which Salty Charlotte built her empire, the flooding of Hollendave and the destruction of the western hobgoblin horde, the Spellpool Mishap, the first death of Magnamalum, and the shattering of Tiamat.

After the War of the Last Dragons and the shattering of Tiamat, Namodo returned to the ruins of Hollandave and rebuilt the city as a tomb, known as the Silent City, in memorial. He sealed the old gates and built seven towers, known as the Seven Spires, along the ruins of the old walls - each dedicated to a particular school of magic. There, he founded the Arcane Order of N’Hollandi and presides as Regent, dedicated to the study of “new magic” brought about by the shattering of Tiamat and, by extension, alternate ways to manipulate the Weave and restore power to the Spellpool.

### Reading this Document

This book was written to serve as an adventurer’s handbook, not as a tool for learning. The entries are piecemeal and composed for simple digestion. Long discourses and cerebral arguments have been omitted in favor of brevity - a lightweight tome of manageable chunks of information for adventurers on the move. The guide has been organized as a directory, not a narrative, so cover-to-cover reading is neither required nor expected. The Table of Contents has been imbued with permanent prestidigitation. Simply tap on the topic you wish to read and the book will flip its pages to the appropriate place.

The second edition of this tome has [useful threads of the weave](http://www.d20pfsrd.com) stitched back to the Arcane Order's apprentice library.

```aside
Yes, that means this book can be detected as a magical object. Archaeologists, fear not! I’ve included an appendix with Nystul’s Magic Aura transcribed. - N
