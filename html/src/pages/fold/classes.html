The berserkers of Rashemen are organized into lodges named after local creatures. These represent an extended family, and a member of a given lodge in one village can always find friends and a place to sleep in the appropriate lodge-house of another village. A lodge also focuses on special skills, weapons, or fighting styles, all based on the creature from which it takes its name. Some lodges are larger and better known than others - the Great Stag and Wolf lodges have a presence in many settlements, while a smaller lodge may only exist in one tiny village.

The lodge-house itself is a typical Rashemi edifice that serves as a tavern, boarding house, and meeting place for members. Many Rashemi berserkers live in their lodge-house, while others visit regularly to drink with their friends, and still others come only when trouble is brewing and they are needed. Each lodge-house is watched over by a telthor, usually of the creature bearing the lodge's name, which warns the berserkers of approaching danger.

Members of the lodges honor and respect one another as brothers (and sisters, for women are not excluded), although there is much rivalry for skill at fighting, hunting, wrestling, jumping, swimming, and feats of strength. To join a lodge, a character must demonstrate the ability to fly into a barbarian rage and pass through a ritual of initiation. This ranges from an all night dunking contest to a single-handed battle against every other member of the lodge (usually dealing nonlethal damage, but not always). An outlander must know something of Rashemen and its ways to join (2 ranks in Knowledge (local - Rashemen)), and must have proved his of her worth in battle against the enemies of Rashemen.

It is possible for a berserker to change lodges, and there is no stigma in doing so.
