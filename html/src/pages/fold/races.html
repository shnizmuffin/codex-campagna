## Dwarves

Stocky, broad of body and extremely muscular, Dwarves may lack in height but not in physical strength or presence. Dwarves are noble warriors who excel at metalcraft, stoneworking, and war. They tend to be serious, determined, and very honorable. Dwarves favor earth tones in their clothing and prefer simple and functional garb. The skin can be very dark, but it is always some shade of tan or brown. Hair color can be black, gray, or brown. Dwarves average 4 feet tall and weigh as much as adult humans.

Dwarves prefer to spend their time making masterpieces of stone, steel, and precious metals. They create durable weapons, craft beautiful jewelry, and cut superior gems. However, they consider it bad taste to flaunt wealth, so few wear jewelry other than one simple piece.

Dwarves speak Dwarven. Most who travel outside dwarven lands (as traders, mercenaries, or adventurers) know the Common tongue, while warriors in the dwarven cities usually learn Goblin to better interrogate and spy on those evil denizens of the deep caves.

Most dwarves encountered outside their home are warriors.

### Hill Dwarves

Hill Dwarves are relatively common in the surface realms. If it weren't for their constant wars with Hobgoblins or Orcs, they'd be far more influential.

### Deep Dwarves (Deep Delvers)

These dwarves live far underground and tend to be more standoffish with nondwarves. Deep dwarves are the same height as other dwarves, but leaner. Their skin sometimes has a reddish tinge, and their large eyes lack the brightness of those of their kindred, being a washed-out blue. Their hair color ranges from bright red to straw blond. They have little contact with surface dwellers, relying on hill dwarves to trade goods for them.

The Deep Dwarves of Fold are more resistant to poisons than their Hill Dwarf cousins. Their time underground has led to a racial ability to see in complete darkness, yet has left them susceptible to bright light.

### Mountain Dwarves

Mountain Dwarves live deeper under the mountains than Hill Dwarves but generally not as far underground as Deep Dwarves. They average about 4-1/2 feet tall and have lighter skin and hair than hill dwarves, but the same general appearance. They claim they were the first dwarf race and that all other dwarves are descended from them, an attitude that contributes to their isolationism.

Aside from their societal views, they are almost identical to Hill Dwarves.

### Gray Dwarves ([Duergar](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-duergar))

Most duergar are bald (even the females), and they dress in drab clothing that is designed to blend into stone. In their lairs they may wear jewelry, but it is always kept dull. They are repulsive and surly, even when compared to other Dwarves. They war with other dwarves, even allying with other underground creatures from time to time. Duergar speak Dwarven and Undercommon.

The Duergar of Fold dwell in subterranean caverns far from the touch of light. They detest all races living beneath the sun, but that hatred pales beside their loathing of their surface-dwarf cousins. Dwarves and duergar once were one race, but the dwarves left the deeps for their mountain strongholds. Duergar still consider themselves the only true dwarves, and the rightful heirs of all beneath the world's surface. In appearance, duergar resemble gray-skinned dwarves, bearded but bald, with cold, lightless eyes. They favor taking captives in battle over wanton slaughter, save for surface dwarves, who are slain without hesitation. Duergar view life as ceaseless toil ended only by death. Though few can be described as anything other than vile and cruel, duergar still value honor and rarely break their word.

## Elves

Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest. They appreciate beautiful things, from elegant jewelry to attractive flowers to decorative clothing and tools. Like dwarves, elves are craftmasters, although they work in wood and metal rather than metal and stone. Elven items are prized by other races, and many elven communities have become prosperous by trading crafted goods with other peoples in and out of the forests.

Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.

### High Elves

High Elves are rare in comparison to humans, as they were driven to near-extinction by dragons and later by orcs and hobgoblins. “Intense racial hatred” barely describes how most elves feel about their oppressors.

### Gray Elves (Tower Elves)

Gray elves are the most noble and regal of all elves. Taller and grander in physical appearance than others of their race, gray elves have a reputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven standards). They certainly are more reclusive than high elves, living in isolated mountain citadels or sequestered towers and allowing entry only to a select few outsiders. They have either silver hair and amber eyes or pale golden hair and violet eyes. They prefer clothing of white, silver, yellow, or gold, with cloaks of deep blue or purple.

When compared to High Elves, Gray Elves tend to be more intelligent, yet weaker.

### Wood Elves (Sylvan aka Savage Elves)

Also called Sylvan, members of this subrace live deep in primordial forests. Their hair color ranges from yellow to a coppery red, and they are more muscular than other elves. Their clothing is in dark shades of green and earth tones to better blend in with their natural surroundings. Their homes are sometimes guarded by giant owls or leopards.

```aside
Although martial in nature, I would hesitate to call them "Savage," especially when compared to your ordinary, short-lived human. - N

When compared to High Elves, Sylvan tend to be stronger, yet less intelligent.

## Gnomes

Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind, living in comfortable burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills where animals abound.

### Forest Gnomes

Shy and elusive, forest gnomes shun contact with other races except when dire emergencies threaten their beloved homes. They are the smallest of all the gnomes, averaging 2 to 2-1/2 feet in height, but look just like regular gnomes except with bark-colored or gray-green skin, and eyes that can be brown or green as well as blue. A very long-lived people, forest gnomes have an average life expectancy of 300 years.

### Rock Gnomes (Vivacious + Warden of Nature)

Rock Gnomes stand 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their skin color ranges from dark tan to woody brown, their hair is fair, and their eyes can be any shade of blue. Rock Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Rock Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 200 years, though some can live almost twice as long.

Rock Gnomes are blunt yet hardy warriors.

## Half-Elves

Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue.

Half-elves are the lowest class in elvish society. The rest of civilized society designates them as either small, pretty humans or big, ugly elves. They’re very rare, and most don’t live past infancy. They are always sterile.

## Half-Orcs

Half-orcs average around 6 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these “tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, half-orcs are as varied as their human parents.

Half-orcs are incredibly rare pariahs in civilized society (but sometimes bred and raised for leadership in Orc society), and are nearly always the product of rape. They are always sterile.

## Halflings

Much like gnomes, halflings stick to their own kind. When in the company of other races, they are often mistaken for gnomes or children.

### Deep Halflings (Adaptable Luck + Driven Worker)

These halflings are shorter and stockier than the more common lightfeet. Deep halflings are about 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. Deep halflings take great pleasure in gems and fine masonry, often working as jewelers or stonecutters. They rarely mix with humans and elves but enjoy the company of dwarves and speak Dwarven fluently.

Deep Halflings, due to their proximity to subterranean dwarves, possess a natural proclivity towards the craft and appraisal of stone and metal objects.

### Lightfoot Halflings

Lightfoot Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They have brown or black eyes. Halfling men often have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen. Halflings prefer simple, comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike members of most races, they prefer actual comfort to shows of wealth. Halflings reach adulthood in their early twenties and generally live into the middle of their second century.

### Tallfellow Halflings (Fleet of Foot + Wanderlust)

Tallfellows are somewhat rare among halfling folk. Tallfellows are 4 feet tall or more and weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They generally speak Elven in addition to Common and Halfling, and they greatly enjoy the company of elves.

## Hobgoblins (Magehunter)

Hobgoblins were created long ago by humans as a servile warrior race. They have since broken free of humanity's reign and exist in isolated tribes. Hobgoblins are almost always lawful, but are neither inherently good nor evil. They have an intense racial hatred of orcs, dwarves, and elves. They despise and mistrust the arcane and the Weave in general, which they refer to as “elf magic.”

A typical hobgoblin stands 6½ feet tall and weighs 230 pounds. Hobgoblins’ hair color ranges from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. They have dark orange or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblins’ eyes are yellowish or dark brown, while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often blood red with black-tinted leather. Their weaponry is kept polished and in good repair.

## Humans

Humans are very common and make up about half the civilized population of Fold. Their tolerance of all races has lead to their general dominance of the known world.

## Orcs

Orcs are just as monstrously powerful and barbaric as ever, but they sometimes work with other races when their interests align. Orcs are savage and bloodthirsty, and such alliances rarely last. Orcs are almost always chaotic and usually evil. Orcs don't get along well with anyone, and have an intense racial hatred of Hobgoblins, Dwarves, and Elves.
