## Armors

###  Magnamalum’s Armor
[Magnamalum’s Armor]:#Magnamalums_Armor

Also known as the **Armor of the Dread Emperor**, This suit of +1 full plate has four 5-foot chains connected to it at the waist. Each chain has a ring manacle sized to fit around a humanoid neck. If people are placed in these manacles by either the armor’s wearer or his minions, the armor is ready to display its true power. Whenever the wearer takes damage, the captives held by the chains take half the damage themselves. If the chains hold more than one person, divide the half damage among all of them. Operating in this armor with chains attached to other people is difficult. The wearer takes an additional –5 armor check penalty unless the victims are somehow magically subdued or controlled, such as by stupor or dominate person. If the captives are children, the additional armor check penalty is only –2. If the captives are subdued or controlled children, there is no additional armor check penalty.

### Rickard Valentino’s Half-Plate
[Rickard Valentino’s Half-Plate]:#Rickard_Valentinos_HalfPlate

When worn by a non-magic-user, this full suit of Red Steel Half-Plate Armor +2 grants the wearer improved resistance to fire, absorbing the first 20 points of fire damage per round. When worn by a non-magic-user who is also wearing [Rickard Valentino’s Crown][], [Rickard Valentino’s Winged Boots][], and [Rickard Valentino’s Spiked Gauntlets][], the user gains complete resistance to fire, as well as additional powers associated with the Winged Boots.

The Half-Plate, by itself, does not function for magic-users. When worn by a magic-user who is also wearing Rickard Valentino’s Crown, Winged Boots, and Spiked Gauntlets, the user gains all magical abilities of all the pieces, plus the complete resistance to fire and ability to cast featherfall. However, it also saps the wearer's magical energy at a rate of one randomly determined spell per round, and all spells and spell-like abilities immediately fail.

## Shields

### The Soulfire Bulwark
[The Soulfire Bulwark]:#The_Soulfire_Bulwark

The Soulfire Bulwark is a Mithral Tower Shield +3 of considerable magical power. Being of mithral, it is incredibly light and easy to wield compared to other tower shields. Its weight is half that of similar defenses, has a maximum dexterity bonus of +4, an armor check penalty of -7, and an arcane spell failure chance of 40%. In addition to its martial excellence, the Bulwark shields the wearer from most forms of necromancy. The wearer, as long as they are able to wear and properly wield the shield, is immune to all death spells, magical death effects, and energy drain, and any negative energy effects (such as from chill touch or inflict spells).

A magical shield matching the description appears in a Rashemi children’s tale, “The Deathless Dwarf,” about a giant dwarf warrior who became dependant on magic and powerless against his ultimate mortality.

As the tale is told:

> The giant dwarf Grogthok Skullsplitter and his party - all ferocious combatants during the Age of Dragons - stood surrounded and outnumbered by an entire detachment of knights. Rather than surrender, Grogthok insulted the virility of the detachment’s leader and baited him into single combat. Grogthok dismembered the slow and ponderous knight with speed and grace, and won the shield as a prize.
>
> However, Grogthok was severely wounded in the battle that followed, and even his closest companions thought him walking dead. Miraculously he recovered, and attributed his good fortune on the shield. Grogthok’s tale tells of the warrior winning battles and gold and glory.
> 
> ```aside
> ...and all the other things you’d expect from a Rashemi bedtime story. - N
> ```
> 	
> Throughout a decade of adventure, Grogthok survived mortal wounds, powerful death magic, prolonged thirst, and starvation - his recklessness completely nullified by armor and magic.
>
> After many fascinating stories, the tale ends with Grogthok confronting a giant blue dragon. The dragon, realizing its raw might and powerful magic could not slay Grogthok, instead planted deep and lasting fear into the dwarf. Grogthok fled the field that day, retreating into the mountain tunnels as his clan was mercilessly slaughtered. It’s told that Grogthok ran for days underground, found the deepest, darkest hole he could, and hid there behind his shield. Grogthok - paralyzed with fear, crippled with shame, and beside himself with grief - stood clutching his shield until his muscles withered and his skin flaked off; until his eyes fell out and his bones turned to dust. It’s said his soul still desperately clutches the shield, horrified and alone.

For a detailed history of The Soulfire Bulwark, see [The Charnel Reaver][].

## Weapons

###  The Charnel Reaver
[The Charnel Reaver]:#The_Charnel_Reaver

The Charnel Reaver is an inherently evil Obsidian Dwarven Waraxe +3 of considerable magical power. Upon vanquishing a foe, the blade wholly consumes the physical form of the slain - prohibiting their resurrection through all but the most powerful spells and prayers.

The history of the Charnel Reaver is a topic of much debate among scholars for a multitude of reasons. The most primary of those being the natural Dwarven reluctance to share any information about Dwarf culture with outsiders. Historians, such as the author of this tome, speculate that the Charnel Reaver is the product of an uneasy truce between the Deep Dwarves of the north and their vile cousins the Duergar. It is believed in the last years of the Age of Dragons, as the dragons turned their attention to the heavily fortified civilizations, the Deep Dwarves and Duergar numbers dwindled so severely that in order to save themselves from total annihilation, the subraces had to agree to an armistice and join forces.

```aside
Both on the battlefield and in the bedroom, if the scandalous Gnomes are to be believed. - N
```

As part of their pact and as an act of mutual good faith, it is believed that the Duergar gave the Reaver, their most powerful weapon, to the King of Hammer. The King, in turn, entrusted his magical shield, The Soulfire Bulwark, to the leader of the Duergar.

After the Dragons fell, the peace dissolved, as did any credible accounts of either magical item being used in combat since. For years, the items were forgotten - assumed to be locked away in vaults or mines or dungeons or whatever manner of storage the Dwarves insist on using this day and age.

That is, until 114 AF. It is a matter of record that the Royal Treasury of the City of Hammer was burgled by a halfling thief of no small skill, specifically seeking to steal the Reaver or the Bulwark. According to his personal journal (recovered by the Arcane Order in the days following his grisly execution), the thief found no weapon - only the device in which it was clearly meant to be placed, preserved, and protected.

Thus the Charnel Reaver was presumed lost without a trace, as those with enough familiarity with its magic to divine its whereabouts had long since passed.

In 141 AF, an item matching the description of the Charnel Reaver was won in combat against the Dreugar "Black Hand" by the Satyr, Ptoluc. The item's power quickly drove him mad.

In 142 AF, the item was encountered by the eventual Shatters of Tiamat, still in the posession of Ptoluc "the Mad." It was was won in combat by the Warmage Rybak, secured in Namodo Nebonic's [Arcanum Corundum][] by Larumthrana Anharu, and eventually sealed away within the Anharu Vault (see [Tomb of Horrors][]) on Seed Island.

### Rickard Valentino’s Spiked Gauntlets
[Rickard Valentino’s Spiked Gauntlets]:#Rickard_Valentinos_Spiked_Gauntlets

Rickard Valentino’s gauntlets, also known as **Doom & Gloom**, are a pair of Dragonbane Spiked Gauntlets +1.

The item, by itself, does not function for magic users. When worn by a magic user who is also wearing Rickard Valentino’s Crown, Winged Boots, and Half-Plate, the user gains all magical abilities of all the pieces, plus the complete resistance to fire and ability to cast featherfall. However, the set saps their magical energy at a rate of one randomly determined spell per round, and all spells and spell-like abilities immediately fail.

## Wonderous Items

### Arcanum Corundum
[Arcanum Corundum]:#Arcanum_Corundum

The Arcanum Corundum is an orb of stone and steel with a single button. When pressed, the user is magically teleported to an extraplanar dungeon containing an arcane maze protecting a livable habitat fit for three people. Six permanent arcane writings, each warded by automatically resetting elemental traps, reveal (when properly disarmed) a passphrase to disable the permanent [Spiritwall](http://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/complete-arcane--55/spiritwall--529/index.html) barring entry to the livable quarters.

> The first ward, revealed with Detect Magic or similar spell, reads, “We seek the answers.”
>
> The second ward, a ruby, disarmed with magical flame, reads, “To the world’s questions.”
>
> The third ward, a yellow bolt-shaped gem, activated with electricity, reads, “No men or beasts will ever.”
>
> The fourth ward, a black skull, unlocked with necromancy, reads, “Deter our quest for truth.”
>
> The fifth ward, an emerald, revealed with acid, reads, “Here we take our respite.”
>
> The sixth ward, a rainbow opal, unlocked with illusion, reads, “To prepare against our foes.”

When recited in the proper order at the precipice of the groaning spiritwall, a clear passage through the wall reveals itself. The living quarters are modest yet spacious, with appropriate furnishings for an extended stay.

```aside
Although, without the Hand of the Maker, one’s stay becomes eternal. - N
```

To exit the Arcanum Corundum, one must don the [Hand of the Maker][] (or be touching its wearer). The wearer and their companions are then shunted through the void into the area immediately surrounding the orb.

The Arcanum Corundum was constructed at least a decade ago by a trio of wizards led by the Necromancer Omando Nebonic. The wizards, imprisoned in the Faith dungeon west of Hollendave, used the orb as a method of escape. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

### Hand of the Maker
[Hand of the Maker]:#Hand_of_the_Maker

The Hand of the Maker is a modified [Hand of Glory](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/hand-of-glory) - a mummified hand affixed to a simple chain, meant to be worn as an amulet. If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time.

Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use daylight and see invisibility each once per day.

This particular Hand of Glory also allows the inhabitants of the Arcanum Corundum to return to the Material Plane.

```

### Magnamalum’s Belt
[Magnamalum’s Belt]:#Magnamalums_Belt

Also known as the **Belt of the Dread Emperor**. If a willing (or dominated or helpless) humanoid creature is attached to the wearer of this belt by a chain and a manacle (see [Magnamalum’s Armor][]), the wearer can draw energy from that creature to power spells. The belt of the Dread Emperor functions for all spellcasters who prepare spells (including clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and wizards). The belt enables the wearer to recall a prepared spell, even if the spell has already been cast, as long as the spell was among those he most recently prepared. For each spell recalled, the chained creature takes damage equal to the square of the spell’s level: A recalled 1st level spell deals 1 point of damage, a 2nd-level spell deals 4 points, a 3rd-level spell deals 9 points, and so on, up to an 8th-level spell that deals 64 points of damage. If the chained creature does not have enough hit points left to power a desired spell, the spell fails and the creature dies.
