Charlottesburg
----

The port city of Charlottesburg, founded in 157 AF by Salty Charlotte and her Tiamat Trading Company to serve as the northernmost destination of their trade network. The population and wealth of the city exploded when Charlotte expertly negotiated a trade agreement securing exclusive rights to all Rashemi wares exported across Charlotte's Strait.

Charlottesburg is, technically, a colony. It is governed by edicts and missives sent from Charlottesport - the central port city of the Tiamat Trading Company. As a colony, the city scoffs at regional laws and maintains a very libertarian political atmosphere. Outside of enforcing basic safety and property laws, the local magistrate has little power. The city's libertarian laws make it a haven for fugitives and outcasts of all kinds, from runaway children, serfs who escaped their lord's lands, criminals and escaped slaves alike.

```aside
In fact, foreign adventurers and bounty hunters cannot arrest or capture fugitives within the settlement's borders. - N
```

To maintain a semblance of security, by local law, any weapon larger than a dagger (including wands and rods) must either be peacebound or stored at one of the gatehouses for the duration of the visit. Peacebonding a weapon involves winding a colored cord tightly around the weapon and its scabbard, and then impressing the local seal in wax. Removing the peacebond requires a full round action before the item can be drawn. (Disable Device DC 12 to untangle the bond as a move equivalent action; bond hp 5, no hardness).

1. **[Lillian's Innian][].** The worst inn in all of Charlottesburg.
1. **[The Murdered Fool][].** An inn that resells the weapons left behind by dead adventurers.
1. **[The Sovereign Plaza][].** A very good marketplace.
1. **[Beggar's Chase][].** A less reputable marketplace.

The Murdered Fool is a two-storey timber and brick building, with a yellow tile roof and a tiled mosaic floor. Accommodations consist of several large rooms with beds and woolen mattresses.

```aside
Neither the accommodations nor the menu are the reason to visit The Murdered Fool. The most compelling reason is the innkeeper's arrangement with the western gatehouse guards.

Downing
----

[Downing][] is a large port, although smaller and less popular than Ianhill and Tipton, situated on the tip of a peninsula at the mouth of the Lager Bay. The town, a main point of commerce between The Hills and the Silmaril Region, was erected around the enclave of the Arcane Order, a walled-off university for adepts. The enclave, colloquially referred to as the “Wizards’ College,” is centered around a massive thirty-three story tower - easily visible for miles.
Downing itself is home to a sizable population of merchants and traders, the most successful of which determine tax rates, impose levies, and self-regulate the immediate area’s commerce in lieu of a more traditional government. Although wealthy and resourceful, the ruling merchants ultimately depend on the protection (and, sometimes, the mercy) of the Arcane Order, who have no qualms with the town’s self-regulation outside the university’s walls.

Jonathan Stonecap the Third, an aged yet shrewd aristocrat, and Ellar Galas, a moderately powerful wizard, act as representatives of the powerful factions when dealing with disputes and the general administration required to run a large town.

1. **[Copper Crossing][].** Middle class shops.
1. **[The Docks][].** Lower class waterfront district.
1. **[Stonesthrow][].** Lower class inn district.
1. **[The Tinderbox][].** Lower class warehouse district.
1. **[Tower of the Arcane Order of Downing][].** High class walled enclave.

### Copper Crossing
[Copper Crossing]:#copper-crossing

> Well-guarded nobles saunter from shop to shop, seemingly oblivious to the more ordinary citizens who rush by with their arms full of packages.

Copper Crossing, located between Tinderbox and the Wizard’s College, serves as Downing’s downtown shopping area. It is clean, spacious, and well-lit, encouraging trade into the evening hours.

	Middle class. Temple, average lodging (3), average food (10), exotic trades (3), upscale trades (12), average trades (35), poor trades (10), upscale services (3), average services (10), poor services (2).

### The Docks
[The Docks]:#the-docks

> Most of the traffic here consists of sailors in search of liquor or entertainment. Bars, flophouses, and small shops - many of which don’t bother to advertise the nature of their business - line the street.

Visitors who arrive by ship often get their first taste of a city in the waterfront district. Adventurers typically feel right at home in this rough-and-tumble place. Ships are readily available for charter, no matter who the passenger, what the cargo, when the time, or where the destination.

	Lower class. Poor lodging (5), poor food (9), poor trades (25), poor services (35), poor residences (20).

### Stonesthrow
[Stonesthrow]:#stonesthrow

> Music and laughter wafts from the open doors of half a dozen inns and commonhouses. Each offers the promise of food, drink, dancing, or perhaps even more exotic diversions.

The inn district in Downing is the result of being the last stop between The Hills and Silmaril. Nicknamed Stonesthrow by the residents, the inn district is an area of the city with an unusually high amount of lodging in a small area. It is rundown simply because it has few permanent residents to care about its upkeep, and the transients who stay there spend most of their time in other districts.

	Lower class. Average lodging (8), poor lodging (25), average food (5), poor food (20), average trades (5), poor trades (15), average services (5), poor services (15).

### The Tinderbox
[The Tinderbox]:#the-tinderbox

> The massive warehouses that give this district its name dominate the landscape. The streets are devoid of life except for the occasional delivery wagon and the guards who stand watch at some warehouse doors.

Cramped rows of wooden warehouses separate the Docks from the rest of the city. Dangerous at night, the Tinderbox tends to accommodate unsavory individuals and malcontents. Named due to its propensity to catch fire, most of the city’s citizens snicker about freak fires, or Wizard’s Lightning - alleged collusion between the Tower wizards and wealthy merchants to ignite warehouses and later collect insurance compensation. Cynics enjoy making bets over which bursts into flame next, the Tower or the Tinderbox.

	Lower class. Warehouses (30), poor trades (5), poor services (10), poor residences (55).

### Tower of the Arcane Order of Downing
[Tower of the Arcane Order of Downing]:#tower-of-the-arcane-order-of-downing

The Tower of the Arcane Order is a walled district in the center of the city of Downing enclosing a university dedicated to the arcane study of the eight magical schools. Residence is limited to students, faculty, and staff, but the grounds are open for general commerce until midnight. At the center of the district stands the actual tower, the largest second largest known active repository of knowledge arcana. Its massive library and near limitless resources attract all manner of spellcaster, philosopher, historian, and treasure hunter. Although access to the majority of the tower is restricted for Mages of the Arcane Order, the Grounds and lowest levels of the tower are open to all (provided they have the skill to conduct their own research or the coin to hire someone who does).

	Standard (magical hierarchical oligarchy); AL N; 1,200gp base, 6,000gp limit; 3d4 minor, 1d6 medium, 0 major, spellcasting 7th; Population 1,205; Diverse (60% human, 30% elf, 9% gnome, 1% halfling). Corruption -2, Crime, Economy, Law, Lore +5, Society -2; Academic, Magically Attuned; Danger 0; Notable NPCs: Algor Toronor, male high elf Wiz10/Mag10 (Regent of the Arcane Order of Downing); Galmalgol Fing, male gray elf Wiz5/Mag9 (Speaker of the Arcane Order of Downing); Diana Pianuso, female human Wiz7 (Provost). Important Characters: Dryan Acrid Jr., male human Wiz13 (Senior Abjurer); Alter Wete, male human Sor10 (Senior Conjurer); Lord Peter Salt, male half-elf Wiz11 (Senior Diviner); Thacka “Wacka” Thunderpillow, female dwarf Wiz4/Mag7 (Senior Enchanter); Jerry “Shocking” Graspt, male human Sor11 (Senior Evoker); Cillymelianna “Cilly” Arcanarita Bedshirethrop, female gnome Sor4/Mag7 (Senior Illusionist); Quarr Auvryn, male elf Wiz4/Mag7 (Senior Necromancer); Daneli Aldilbor, male elf Wiz11 (Senior Transmuter); Gonethir Stone, male gray elf Wiz9 (Senior Historian); Finde Findelye female elf Wiz6/Mag4 (Senior Librarian).

#### The Grounds

> Young, well-dressed students carrying armfuls of scrolls and books hustle to their classes. Others sit or stand in circles, discussing the day’s lessons. Continual flames illuminate the streets, and entertaining, artistic illusions decorate some of the buildings. The berobed citizens frequently display flashy magic - typically glamers. Useful magic items abound.

The colleges in this district teach everything from Knowledge and Profession skills to the secrets of divine and arcane magic. Adventurers can find esoteric lore and answers to obscure riddles here, as well as buy, sell, and trade magical items and artifacts.

Applicants to the Arcane Order must provide a written recommendation from a current member of the Order to undergo the entrance examination, usually administered by Spellpool Level II faculty of their requested specialized school. Those declaring as Universal are usually tested alongside the Evokers. For some, the test can prove fatal.

Students, referred to as acolytes, live in the dormitories and residences around the tower until they complete their basic education and meet the requirements imposed upon all Mages of the Arcane Order. There is no set timetable (or guarantee) for admission into the Arcane Order, and not all acolytes choose to join. During their years attending the university, acolytes are expected to assist members in the tower’s alchemical and magical laboratories, volunteer their time tending to the libraries and archives, and aid in the constant organization and reorganization (coined “trudging” by a former student) of the Tower’s massive storerooms. Acolytes, through hard work and dedication, usually earn their membership by acquiring an apprenticeship with current members working and administering those areas.

A “guild-level” mage of the Arcane Order pays monetary dues and accepts various duties in return for member benefits. The dues are 30 gp per month. Duties include putting in an appearance on campus at least once every six months and accepting any special commissions handed down by senior members. A guildmage who falls into arrears on his dues by more than three months has his membership revoked and loses access to the Spellpool. Reinstating membership is difficult. However, ex-members do not lose any spells or metamagic feats they had gained while in good standing.

A member in good standing can board at the Arcane Order campus between adventures, paying only 5 sp per day for common-quality meals and lodging. At his leisure, he can browse the Order’s well-respected library, which is stocked with tomes on both mundane and arcane lore (though no spellbooks are kept here). Likewise, he can use the Order’s common laboratory facilities when creating magic items (although material costs remain out-of-pocket).

	Upper class. University buildings, (including instruction and faculty offices) (4), mundane library, temple, upscale lodging (5), upscale food (8), upscale literary trades (booksellers, stationers, mapsellers, sealmakers, and the like) (10), upscale literary services (scribe, sage, translator, cartographer, and the like) (10), dormitories (5), upscale residences (25), magic item dealers (2), spellcasters for hire (6).

#### Tower, Common Levels (1-3)

```aside
The first three levels of the Tower are open to the general public. They’re usually crowded and tend to smell... burnt. - N
```

The common levels are were non-members usually enlist the help of members. The first floor is mainly a courtyard where members read and post notices to the “job board,” a mundane medium whereby fellow members of the Order pass information, advertise their interest in a research topic or adventure, or attempt to sell an interesting oddity, magical or otherwise. The second is filled with laboratory space, a basic reference library, and servants quarters. The third is populated by a banquet hall and a large auditorium, usually reserved for commencement and addresses to the magical community by senior members.

	Upper class. Basic alchemical laboratories (10), basic magical laboratories (10), magic item dealers (5), banquet hall, fancy auditorium, fancy courtyard, basic arcane library, servants quarters (4).

#### Tower, Lower Levels (4-10)

> A translucent field of blue magical energy bars passage to the common man where members of the order pass with ease.

The Arcane Order’s massive library is closed to the general public. Members, and those fortunate enough to be friends of members, may peruse the eight levels of written knowledge at their leisure. Acolytes can be hired to aid in research. Administration and requisitions offices are housed in the lower levels, and members may choose to live within the tower’s basic residences. The maximum resident population is 150, and seniority dictates eligibility.

	Restricted access, Spellpool Level I. Fancy arcane library, requisitions office, administrative offices, basic storage, basic residences (5).

#### Tower, Middle Levels (11-20)

> A translucent field of prismatic magical energy bars passage to the newly initiated where higher level members of the order pass with ease.

The middle levels are reserved for faculty with tenure, and provide special laboratories for their continued research. The maximum resident population is 30, and seniority dictates eligibility.

	Restricted access, Spellpool Level II. fancy alchemical laboratories (5), fancy magical laboratories (5), basic offices (30), fancy residence.

#### Tower, Upper Levels (21-30)

> The staircase ends in a solid wall that senior members of the order pass through with the aid of powerful spells.

The upper levels serve as the permanent residence of the Senior Members of the Arcane Order. Each has their own private level, including laboratories, specialized libraries, and office space. They are tended to by servants and top-of-the-class acolytes. After the speaker of the order, eight college heads, head librarian, and head historian are accommodated, the rest of the livable space is awarded by invitation only to special members of the arcane community.

	Restricted access, Spellpool Level III. Private wizard’s research laboratories (9), luxurious residence.

#### Tower, Regent’s Quarters (31-33)

The top levels of the tower belong exclusively to the Regent. He enjoys the same benefits the Senior Members do, with more privacy.

The regents set the Arcane Order’s rules and policies, meeting each month in the Council of Regents. A regent must attend six council meetings in one year or be removed from the council and lose his regent status (he loses no other benefits of guild membership). Enacting new policies or eradicating old ones requires a three-fifths majority vote to pass.

```aside
It is rumored that the Regent of Downing, Algor Toronor - an 800-year-old high elf, has not left his quarters for one hundred forty years. Normally, this would result in the loss of his Regent status, but Toronor has been alive longer than the council meeting attendance policy. He appointed Galmalgol Fing as his “Speaker” to perform typical regent duties and keep Downing informed of the Order’s actions abroad.

Whispers among those old enough to remember suggest that Toronor slipped into a trance he has yet to awaken from. Some believe his mind left his body and perished on the astral plane. Others say his constant divination has made him a being removed from time, joined with the Weave. Cynics say Galmalgol trapped him in his dreams to usurp his rule and optimists say he is casting a Wish so complicated and righteous it has taken four decades to negotiate the terms. It has even been suggested that Toronor was robbed of his power to fill the Spellpool. This Transmuter assures you, that is not the case. - N
```

Generally, the council hands out commissions for lower level mages of the Arcane Order to perform on behalf of the guild. An individual regent might also head up a special group of lower-level members to accomplish a specific goal, such as investigating a crime committed using magic, undertaking an archeological dig of an ancient site of wizardry, or some other important task.

	Restricted access, Regent & Speaker. Private wizard’s research laboratory, luxurious residence, focus chamber.

#### Tower, Basement (Sublevels 1-3)

The basement is where most supplies are stored in bulk. Narrow servant’s stairways lead to appropriate rooms on the first three floors. Supplying the upper levels requires Dimension Door, Teleport, or similar methods.

	Restricted access, Spellpool Level II. Fancy storage (3).

#### Tower, Subbasement (Sublevels **REDACTED**)

You have no business in the subbasement.

	Restricted access, Senior Mages. Treasury, artifact storage, spellpool, [REDACTED], tower archives, [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

Earthill
----

[Earthill][]'s largest and most common exports are copper and iron, but a few companies have silver mines just outside the city limits. One copper mine has recently discovered emerald deposits.

Well off and wealthy citizens, such as mine owners, members of the miners' guild, skilled craftsmen, and most traveling merchants reside in the Hillcrest district of the city - a pleasant, gated community built twenty feel up into the rocky foot of the last mountain. Most of Earthill's population, which is around a thousand people, live on the brown rocky soil of Slagbottom, near the various mine entrances. Miners, commoners, and peasants live in ramshackle stone and wood huts barely ten feet across.

1. **[Miner’s Guildhall][].** A members-only walled enclave.
1. **[The Bearded Lady][].** A common whorehouse.
1. **[Boozy Wagon Tavern][].** A common inn.
1. **[The Gilded Lily][].** A wealthy whorehouse.
1. **[Stonehouse Hostel][].** A poor flophouse.
1. **[Black Rock Hotel][].** A wealthy inn.
1. **[Slagbottom Marketplace][].** Poor marketplace.
1. **[Hillcrest Marketplace][].** Common marketplace.

### Miner’s Guildhall
[Miner’s Guildhall]:#miners-guildhall

The Miner’s Guildhall is a walled enclave built primarily of stone. Its expert masonry and grand size is betrayed by its sparse furnishings and lackluster amenities. Guildmaster Thoril Riverrock, a dwarf, administers the day to day mining operations in Earthill from within the council chambers.

```
Max Occupancy: 18 private (guild leaders), 30 common area (1sp/day guild members only); Menu: roast pork (members only), ale (2cp/mug members only), common wine (3sp/pitcher members only).
```

### The Bearded Lady
[The Bearded Lady]:#the-bearded-lady

The Bearded Lady is a one-storey stone and timber brothel with a claustrophobically low ceiling. The reinforced wooden door opens into a bar, with dwarf-wrought iron tables and chairs. Human women in loose-fitting dresses strut from table to table, soliciting patrons. Groans, moans, squeaks, knocks, and rhythmic slapping emanate from a hallway leading deeper into the establishment. The stench of fornication is palpable.

The Bearded Lady whorehouse is owned by Thali “Redbeard” Mossbottom (dwarf Exp4/War1), a ribald and lascivious middle-aged dwarf with wavy black hair cut short at the shoulders. Thali was once betrothed to a council member of the miner’s guild, Thoril Riverock, but was left standing at the altar fifty years ago. She founded The Bearded Lady shortly afterward, swearing off romance entirely.

Thali encourages patrons to drink a pitcher of wine and partake in the brothel’s basement - a dark, dank steam room doubling as an orgy pit. For those inclined to privacy, there are eight private rooms available, each with their own whore (who can be seen floating around the bar when not abed, seeking their next customer). The basement usually has six girls in it, but that number can be doubled in the event of full patronage. She informs guests that they pay per hour or per “pop,” whichever comes first.

A character seeking “companionship” is at risk of contracting Red Ache or Crimson Welts.

```aside
This is a second-hand account. The last person to suggest otherwise spent the last moments of their short life trapped in the body of a frog. - N
```

```
Max Occupancy: 8 private (5sp/hour), 12 basement (1gp/hour); Menu: meat pie (1 sp), ale (5cp/mug), common wine (3sp/pitcher).
```

### Boozy Wagon Tavern
[Boozy Wagon Tavern]:#boozy-wagon-tavern

The Boozy Wagon Tavern is a simple wooden shack, with several shuttered windows. A large cask of ale lies tapped next to the lacquered pine bar, and several wobbly wooden tables line the walls. Suspended from the ceiling are two re-purposed wagon wheels, serving as chandeliers, each with eight small candles. Accommodations consist of several hammocks in a shared back room or a modest bed in private quarters.

```aside
If the Black Rock is booked solid, expect that private chamber to cost a fair sight more than 2gp. Also, the proprietor at the time of writing did not value sentient frogs. - N
```

```
Max Occupancy: 6 shared (5sp), 2 master (2gp); Menu: game pie (5sp), potted partridge (4sp), ale (3cp/mug), common wine (1sp/pitcher);
```

### The Gilded Lily
[The Gilded Lily]:#the-gilded-lily

The Gilded Lily is filled with clean, beautiful women and men of all sizes and shapes. The food smells excellent. The Lily keeps a small reserve of Firewine Brandy, the pure form of Firewine produced in Rashemen. It’s typically kept off the menu, as its effects beyond mere intoxication risk the general well being of the courtesans.

```aside
A forcibly enraged and intoxicated amphibian is a curiosity unmatched by most traveling carnivals. - N
```

```
Max Occupancy: 6 private (5gp/hour), 8 shared (10gp/hour); Menu: roast goose with apple sauce (7sp), gosling with damson cheese (5sp), oyster soup (2sp), fine wine (10gp/bottle), Hilltop Wine 138AF (3,000gp), Firewine (30gp/bottle), Firewine Brandy (300gp/bottle).
```

### Stonehouse Hostel
[Stonehouse Hostel]:#stonehouse-hostel

The hostel is little more than a large shack, densely packed with cots. The hostel stinks of filth, and there are rat droppings in plain sight. Patrons are at risk of contracting Filth Fever.

```
Max Occupancy: 24 common (2sp), 56 floor (5cp); Menu: stew (5cp), clear soup (2cp).
```

### Black Rock Hotel
[Black Rock Hotel]:#black-rock-hotel

The Black Rock is typically at or near maximum occupancy most of the time, as it is the only safe, clean, and reputable lodging in the city.

```
Max Occupancy: 24 private (2gp); Menu: buffet (10gp), common wine (3sp/pitcher).
```

### Slagbottom Marketplace
[Slagbottom Marketplace]:#slagbottom-marketplace

At the Slagbottom Marketplace you can purchase any mundane item worth less than 50gp at 50% market price. You can sell any item, at 25% market price, until reaching a 250gp limit. There is no magic for sale.

### Hillcrest Marketplace
[Hillcrest Marketplace]:#hillcrest-marketplace

At the Hillcrest Marketplace you can purchase any mundane item worth less than 500gp at 110% market price. You can sell any item, at 45% market price, until reaching a 2,500gp limit. There are typically a handful of low-level magic items for sale.

Greenpoint
----

[Greenpoint][] is a small elvish city renown for its strange magical aura ruled by a dynastic council.

A powerful magical aura hangs over Greenpoint, an elvish city carved from the living heart of the Forbidden Forest. The trees form themselves into homes, and branches bend to provide the settlement’s inhabitants with food in the form of magical, druid-tended fruits and berries. All creatures of the Animal type gain the ability to speak and think while within the settlement’s borders. Greenpoint is home to Arcane Order of the Forbidden Forest who reside in a massive living oak tree at the north end of the city.

The following typically illegal behaviors are permitted in and around the city of Greenpoint:

- Homosexuality
- Beastiality
- Polyamory

The following behaviors are not permitted and are severely punished in and around the city of Greenpoint:

- Riding, tethering, or otherwise using an animal as a pack beast without their express permission
- Slaughtering animals and/or eating meat
- Cutting down, shaving, or otherwise harming trees
- Taking more food from the trees than one needs for a single meal
- Prostitution

[Highway][] is a small village built on an old plantation, home to about 200 people - mostly humans. The buildings are a mix of brick and timber, most of which are small cottages. The three largest buildings, all situated on one main road, consist of the town hall, the Thin Slug Inn, and the former Highwayfarers’ Guildhall. The town generates income by servicing merchants traveling along the coast between The Hills and Rashemen, farms enough produce and raises enough livestock to sustain itself, and generally provides safe haven from the wilderness of the surrounding area. The townsfolk are insular and superstitious, but generally accommodating and law-abiding.

1. **[Thin Slug Inn][].** The only inn.
1. **[Abandoned Guildhall][].** A vacant property.
1. **[Highway Town Hall][].** Little more than a large shack.

### Thin Slug Inn
[Thin Slug Inn]:#thin-slug-inn

The Thin Slug is a three-storey timber and brick farmhouse serving as Highway’s only inn. Its ground floor has been converted into a respectable dining area, serving modest portions of local fare at reasonable prices. The interior is well lit with wall sconces and a fireplace, which fill the room with the pleasant smell of smouldering firewood. The second floor has six shared rooms which comfortably sleep four people each, available for rent at 5sp per night. The top floor has two private rooms with average locks, available for rent at 2gp per night. Stabling with full livery, for rent at 5sp per horse per day, and privies reside a short walk from the inn - behind the establishment and off the main road.

In times of full occupancy, the management converts the first floor into a common room with bedrolls for rent at 5cp per night.

The inn is owned and operated by landowner and mayor Erwin Briggs and his wife Matilda, who employ a few townsfolk to run the kitchen and dining room. Erwin and Matilda make their living running the inn and collecting rent on most of the residences in Highway. Erwin is a fair, trusting, and generous man. Matilda is a fading beauty ten years younger than Erwin, bored with village living, with a drinking problem.

	Max Occupancy: 24 shared (5sp), 4 master (2gp), 48 floor (5cp); Menu: leg of mutton (4sp), boiled rabbit (1sp), crayfish soup (4 cp), two-copper ale (2cp).

### Abandoned Guildhall

Neras
----

[Neras][] is the largest elvish city north of Seed. It serves as the capital city of the Elves in the north.

The settlement possesses an ancient museum of magical rarities, the Hall of Wonder. The Hall is stocked and staffed by wizards with expertise in history and spellcraft, under the tutilage of the Queen's Wizard Kryptona the Green.

This settlement is home to the Silver Market - an entire city district of powerful banks, mints, trading houses, currency exchanges and other powerful financial and mercantile organizations.

The settlement is dominated by a single race, elves. It is the location of The Viridian Capitol - a large palace devoted to extramural legislation (such as border definitions, defensive pacts, peace treaties, and trade agreements) between city-states and the elves of the Forbidden Forest.

### Demon's Maw
[Demon's Maw]:#demons-maw

Contains a portal to the [Labyrinth of Thelhesera][].

Labyrinth of Thelhesera
----
[Labyrinth of Thelhesera]:#labyrinth-of-thelhesera

```aside
Beware, apprentices died to bring me this information. Although recently purged of inhabitants, this ancient location is very dangerous. - N
```

The Labyrinth of Thelhesera is an abyssal deathtrap built around the treasure horde of the Wizard of Thelhesera - a powerful and ancient magic user dominated by the Succubus Tari Palentir. Until recently, it had doubled as the vault of the Thieves' Guild in Neras.

The Labyrinth is lethally cold for those unprepared for it. Those exposed eventually suffer from hypothermia.

### The Entrance

The portal of the Demon's Maw exits into this room from the east wall. There is no return portal. Those who pass through the portal have all magical items within the divination (scrying) school removed and replaced with intert and/or cursed duplicates.

There are two secret doors completely covered by a Stone Shape spell. The aura of the spell has long passed. Investigation reveals only that the sections of walls are smoothed out. There are no cracks, nor are there any indications of secret passages.

There is a mural on the 30' ceiling created with clear, reflective paint that can only be seen when the room is lit. It depicts a town between two cliffs being washed away in a flood while a black goat with the wings of a bat and a white stag with eagle's wings battle above.

```aside
The town, Thelhessera, is known today as Neras. Legend holds that the city was washed away by the Spirit of the Forest to purge its wickedness. - N
```

The west entry is an unlocked iron door. The south door is an unlocked bone door with a triggered [Guillotine Blade Trap][].

#### Behind the Bone Door

There are two decomposing halfling corpses behind the bone door. The room is otherwise empty.

### Yeth Hound Den

The entrance to this room is an Iron Door concealed by an illusion. It is a [Yeth Hound][Yeth Hound] den. The floor in this room is uneven flagstone. Running across the surface is dangerous. The ceiling in this room is 100' high. There is a hidden chute in the ceiling that allows Yeth Hounds passage in and out of specific portions of the dungeon.

### Cloaker Corridor

The passage leading away from the yeth hound den has a mercifully even and well-worked stone floor. It is perfectly level and expertly polished. The walls transition from rough masonry to polished black rock, as does the twenty foot ceiling. This dark corridor is filled with traps, of which there are two. The northernmost is a [Large Electrified Floortile Trap][]. The second is a [Hail of Arrows Trap][].

The polished black rock is coal and will ignite if sufficiently heated. If ignited, fire spreads in all directions at 5' per round until the entire vein is alight. The corridor fills with [smoke](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Smoke-Effects) after three rounds, reaches [severe heat](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Heat-Dangers) after five rounds and [extreme heat](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Heat-Dangers) after ten. Any creature caught in a flaming corridor after ten rounds of burning runs the risk of [suffocation](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Suffocation).

A fire of such nature can be [doused](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/environmental-rules#TOC-Dousing-a-Fire) if the adventurers have sufficient non-flammable material. It may also be extinguished by sealing all doors leading into the corridor in an air-tight manner. Extinguishing a fire in this manner takes one hour to snuff the flames, two hours to return the corridor's temperature to a safe level, and four hours to dissipate the smoke.

```aside
I wonder how they found that out. - N
```

Writing, in halfling, is scrawled on the wall with chalk. "You cannot kill it with magic."

### Chet's Room

This room's entrance is a Locked Iron Door. The door opens into a large, strange room. At its center is a three foot tall stone pillar, about two feet in diameter. Surrounding the pillar at a ten foot radius are large metal eye bolts. Each bolt is sunk deeply into the room's flooring - long, straight planks of finished walnut. The expertly crafted wood lines the room as well, as a two-foot high baseboard. Above the baseboard, bones. Hundreds of interlocking bones, jigsawed and rearranged, line the walls and ceiling.

The room served as the prison of [Chet][], an Intelligent Metamagic Rod of Toppling. It was previously a prison cell for a young white dragon.

Further investigation of the floor in general reveals serious damage to the wood and a few loose eye bolts stripped from their mooring. Deep, claw-like gouges in the flooring near the podium. Splintering around some of the eye bolts - some of them have been ripped from their mooring in the stone under the floorboards. There are old blood stains around the room, none larger or darker than the one immediately surrounding the pedestal.

The pedestal itself rests on top of the stained wooden floor. Its weight has compressed the wood under it.

A subtle illusion conceals the outline of a secret door four feet above the floor, hidden in the busy patterns of the east bone wall.

#### Chet's Secret Compartment

The original purpose of this compartment was to contain live animals for an imprisoned dragon to consume.

The hidden door is a short, wide hatch which swings open from the middle like a cow pen. Dust and cobwebs hang in the compartment's stagnant air. A pair of dessicated corpses lay crumpled in an unnatural pile.

### Serpentine Hall of Soul Eaters

The passage leading north from the yeth hound den has a relatively even flagstone floor. The twenty-foot masonry walls terminate abruptly at a rough stone ceiling. At their base, the walls are intermittently lined with bones - some stacks over five feet high, but never spilling in to the passageway. The bones seem deliberately placed into an eerily beautiful - if not macabre - sort of mosaic.

This hall is littered with the petrified remains of thieves and the withered body of a dead Medusa.

The Medusa, a former servant of the Wizard of Thelhesera Angrolas Olon, clutches an appropriated journal from one of the adventurer's she'd previously slain. In it, she details how her master abandoned her in the labyrinth - a duty turned prison she could not escape without her master's magic. On the last few pages, she documents the arrival of great and terrible evil. 

> "Demons of shadow and the drinkers of souls now roam my halls. Abyssal hounds bar my passage, and the traps elsewhere are too lethal and indiscriminate to test. My food is gone, both the Lembas and the rats that used to scurry these paths. The shadows refuse to grant me release. I envy my thieving prey. Their rigid forms as lifeless as I wish to be. Their fear and pain came to swift and abrupt terminus. They felt no hunger - no betrayal. I am going to starve. I am going to wither and die here. Curse you, Angrolas Olon. What grievance condemned me to this fate?"

The rest of the journal is empty.

#### The Troll Door

The northern entrance to the [Torture Chamber of the Balisse Angel](#torture-chamber-of-the-balisse-angel) is a secret locked Bone Door concealed behind the petrified form of a troll crossbowman, half-engulfed in twisted bones reaching out from the wall. It opens by pulling a bolt in its quiver.

### Torture Chamber of the Balisse Angel

The walls and floor of this room are made of bone, masoned together with some sort of epoxy. The ceiling rises up 50', also all bones. At the center of the room are dozens of bloody iron bolts.

```aside
This room contained a confessor angel, Praevian, bolted to the floor to serve as food for [Shadows][Shadow]. He had been bolted to the floor to prevent escape or resistance, and drained of nearly all his strength. Given his resistance to evil, the drain was slow and unfathomably painful.

Praevian escaped the Labyrinth with the aid of Amara Anharu along with a pitiful gaggle of scraped-together mercenaries. I had the fortune of meeting this rare creature. He explained his purpose thusly:

"My charge was the Wizard of Thelhesera, Angrolas Olon. I was to set his considerable power along the path of righteousness. However, a demon interfered. She poisoned his mind and used him to capture me. They imprisoned me in that dark nightmare as food for their unholy nightmares, and kept me alive with vile magic. I couldn't fight. I couldn't flee. I couldn't even die."

His whereabouts are currently unknown. - N
```

The door to the east, a Locked Bone Door, leads to the [Pleasure Room of the Fire Dryads](#pleasure-room-of-the-fire-dryads).

### Pleasure Room of the Fire Dryads

This is a massive room with a checkered floor and six twisted ash columns surrounding a large, shallow pit. The ceiling arcs 50' high at its apex.

```aside
Obedar the Obtuse freed the six [Debased Fire Dryads][Debased Fire Dryad] from this room. A terrible waste. - N
```

The floor's black tiles are made of coal. If they take fire damage, they ignite. 

```aside
I did not instruct this group of apprentices to rate each room by flamibility. - N
```

### Twisted Corridors

The door grinds open into a dark cooridor. The floors, walls, and 20' cieling are lined with large rusty iron panels.

This corridor is home to two [Scythe Blade Traps][Scythe Blade Trap], a [Hail of Arrows Trap][], and a [Magic Missile Trap][]. There are two inert, shattered teleportation crystals in the corridor, but there are no clues to their function.

There is no apparent exit to this maze. There is one secret door, disguised as an iron wall panel.

### The Lair of the Dread Nabasu

Giant saw blades line the walls around a bloody pit of horror.

```aside
In consultation with a diviner, I learned that a Nabasu was planar-bound by the Wizard of Thelhesera to lead a legion of ghouls to conquer Fold. It believed it was to be wed to the Succubus Tari Palentir. It planned to use the Wizard of Thelhesera's power to remain on the Material Plane past maturity, evolve into a Vrolikai, and become King of the Material Plane. - N
```

### Ghoul Legion

This room was filled with three phalanx of [Ghouls](#ghoul).

### Hall of Fire

Floating lights illuminate this tall room. Painted on the west wall of this room is a mural of a demomic sorceress, wreathed in flame. Painted on the east wall is a mural of an ancient lich standing in a frozen tundra. The center of the room is affected by an antigravity field. The ceiling is a pit with spikes. The spikes are poisoned.

```aside
Idiots. - N
```

### Stone Golem Crucible

The shattered remains of a Stone Golem are in this room.

### Crystal Cavern

This room is filled with crystals. The floor is difficult terrain, and razor-sharp.

### Blood Geode Altar

The blood geode requires a pint of blood to activate.

```aside
> Incompetent. - N
```

It teleports creatures one at a time to one of six medallions within [Crocotaur's Maze]().

### Crocotaur's Maze

Six medallions act as one-way teleportation pads for the crystal on the [Blood Geode Altar](). They are five feet in diameter, made mostly of bronze, and each have a unique relief. They are:

- Jaws with blood crystal teeth.
- Reptilian hands with blood crystal claws.
- Reptilian feet with blood crystal talons.
- Horns with blood crystal tips.
- Heart with blood crystal veins and arteries.
- Tail with blood crystal ridges/scales.

A creature known as [Crocotaur]() patroled the maze.

### Crystal Balls of the Succubus

There's a massive crystal ball here that allows passage through it to a sister ball, located under Neras' Hall of Wonder.

> The sister ball is no longer under Neras' Hall of Wonder. It has been appropriated by the Arcane Order and secured in a secret location.
