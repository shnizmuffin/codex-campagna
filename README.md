Codex Campagna
---

Goal: To create an application Game Masters use to build worlds, create campaigns, and author adventures. Codex Campagna will allow GMs to integrate pre-authored content with homebrewed content; manage and reuse that content easily. Codex Campagna will compile full-blown web sites for Game Masters to run at the table, replacing traditional rulebooks and adventure modules.

- Pull stat blocks from existing DBs (Pathfinder Beastiary, Adventure Modules, etc.)
- Push stat blocks to new DBs (User-Specific Homebrews)
- Pull errata from existing DBs (Rule System updates should be automatic)
- Push revisions to homebrewed content, retroactively editing previously authored content
- Run locally
- Integrate with Roll20
- Integrate with online system reference documents

ToDo:

- City stat block partial
- Magic Item stat block partial
- Trap stat block partial
